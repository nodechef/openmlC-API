# C++ API to connect to OpenML server

OpenML is an open source project that aims to create a novel ecosystem for machine learning experimentation. It is possible to integrate different machine learning tools through plugins and APIs to share datasets, experiments and results in the platform. The idea is to write an OpenMLâ€™s plugin in Java for ROOT, that allows the use TMVA in OpenML, and also create an C++ API for TMVA that lets permits the use of OpenML tools from within ROOT.
